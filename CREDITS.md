# NakedMud 4 - Credits and Acknowledgments

NakedMud was originally created by **Geoff Hollis** (1983-2021) beginning around 2003-2004 as an innovative Python-integrated MUD server. Development continues under **Kevin Morgan (LimpingNinja)** to honor Geoff's work and vision. Many thanks to **David Marquardt (Axiom of Ender's Keep)** for the critical support in CPython 2->3 Migration!

## In Memory of Geoff Hollis

Geoff was not just a brilliant programmer, but a warm and encouraging mentor who challenged others to push boundaries. His work on NakedMud, developed during his graduate studies, demonstrated his ability to blend technical excellence with innovative game design. Through our conversations about game theory, linguistics, and technical challenges, Geoff influenced many to pursue game development and explore the psychological aspects of how we develop, play, and learn. His impact on careers and lives extends far beyond the code he wrote. He will always be remembered for his generosity, brilliance, and the doors he opened for others.

## Original Credits

*From Geoff Hollis:*

Thanks go out to **Brian Graversen** for creating SocketMud(tm), which NakedMud(tm) was built on top of. I know nothing (yet) about TCP/IP, and SocketMud(tm) made my life that much easier.

Additional thanks to **Erwin Andreasen** for the code snippets that were incorporated into SocketMud and subsequently into NakedMud.

## Current Development

**Kevin Morgan (LimpingNinja)** - Current maintainer
- Python 3+ modernization and compatibility
- Codebase stabilization and bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Continued development in Geoff's memory

## Special Thanks

To the MUD development community for keeping the spirit of text-based multiplayer gaming alive, and to everyone who has contributed code, bug reports, and feedback to make NakedMud better.

To all the players and builders who have used NakedMud to create worlds and communities - you are the reason this project continues.
